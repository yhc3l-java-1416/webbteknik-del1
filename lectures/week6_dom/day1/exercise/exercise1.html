		// 1) Assign the 3 html paragraphs to seperate javascript variables using document.querySelector and selecting them by their id

		// 2) Change the contents (innerText) of the first paragraph to "This is exciting".

		// 3) Change the contents of the second paragraph to "click on me to turn the third paragraph green". toggle

		// 4) Add left padding of 100px to the second paragraph. Hint check style, by logging your element to console with the console.dir function.

		// 5) Create a function that you attach to paragraph 2's onclick event. The function should toggle a green class to paragraph 3. 


		// 6) Use the console.dir() function to see all the properties and see if you can figure out how to toggle, (switch on and off a class).


		// 7) Extra time exercise. Can you also update the text of paragraph two so that it shows what will happen to paragraph 3. i.e. If paragraph 3 is already green the text should be "click on me to turn the third paragraph white" and not "click on me to turn the third paragraph green".
		
		// 8) Create a javascript variable for all the special elements. Use document.querySelectorAll and a css query to return all elements with a class of special and populate your variable.
		// Write a loop and change the text color of all specialElements to "#bada55";
