	// 1)  Have a look at blocket and create a single object that you think contains all the properties
	//  needed to represent an item on blocket.
	
	// 2) As you will be making lots of these objects and want to minimise the risk of errors. Create an
	// object factory function. A function that takes the values and returns a populated floggit object.
	
	// 3) Create an array with multiple floggit objects in it.
	
	// 4)  Your boss wants to see if your structure is going to work for the list all objects. Create a loop 
	// that loops through all your objects and console.logs just the titles.

	// 5) Advanced can you sort your array by the object price and rerun the loop you created in step 4?
