You are going to create the logic for navigating a user menu. The menu:

	a) Start page
	b) About page
	c) Another page

You will prompt the user to enter a character corresponding to the page and then display text in the console depending on their choice.



1) Create an html file that reads in a javascipt file.
2) Show a prompt with the available pages.
3) Read the users selection and clean up/normalise the input. Both 'A' and 'a' should work. As should '   a  '.
4) Write a switch statement that provides a console.log with the page name of the selected page.
