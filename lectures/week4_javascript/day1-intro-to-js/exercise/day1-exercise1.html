	// Create a simple game
	// The user has 3 chances to guess a number that you have written in your code. The number should be between 1 and 10.
	// If the user guesses correctly you should show an alert saying “Well done”.
	// If they fail to guess within 3 tries alert, “FAILED”. 
	// The tools you'll need: while, if, prompt and alert.
